# Verso Blueprint

Verso Blueprint is a Lean package for writing Blueprint documents in
[Verso](https://github.com/leanprover/verso).

A Blueprint project combines:

- informal mathematical exposition
- links to local Lean code or existing Lean declarations
- optional attached Rust code blocks on labeled nodes for mixed-language notes
- optional external TeX or Markdown markup attachments on labeled nodes to help
  port existing documents
- automatic tracking of formalization progress by analyzing the associated Lean
  code and declarations, including incomplete declarations such as `sorry`
- rendered overview pages such as dependency graphs and progress summaries
- HTML output with previews, navigation, and exported metadata

## Start Here

### Start a project

If you want to start a Blueprint project today, start here:

1. [project_template/README.md](./project_template/README.md)
2. [doc/GETTING_STARTED.md](./doc/GETTING_STARTED.md)
3. [doc/MANUAL.md](./doc/MANUAL.md)
4. [doc/API.md](./doc/API.md) when you need documented Lean, generated-data, or
   browser integration APIs; start with
   [Choosing an API](./doc/API.md#choosing-an-api)

To copy the starter and build its rendered output before renaming the package
and modules:

```bash
cp -R project_template my-blueprint
cd my-blueprint
lake exe vbp build
```

This uses the checked-in Lake manifest and writes the HTML site under
`_out/site/html-multi/`. To preview the site locally, run
`lake exe vbp build --serve`. After that, follow the template README to rename
`ProjectTemplate` to your project name and replace the starter chapters.

After building, query the generated planning data through `vbp` rather than
reading generated JSON files directly:

```bash
lake exe vbp query work-queue
lake exe vbp query metadata
```

## Current Project Shape

Today a Blueprint project usually owns three things:

- chapter modules containing the mathematical content
- a Blueprint top-level file that assembles chapters and rendered overview pages
- a generator entry point that resolves forward references, computes metadata,
  and writes the generated output under `_out/`

`verso-blueprint` provides the Blueprint directives, rendering commands, preview
runtime, and support library code. The starter layout in
[project_template/](./project_template/) shows the recommended shape.
For the broader rendered artifact index, including published reference
blueprints and local test fixtures, see the
[published rendered artifact index](https://leanprover.github.io/verso-blueprint/).

By default, `lake exe vbp build` writes the HTML site under
`_out/site/html-multi/`. Passing `--pdf` also emits TeX and runs `lualatex` to
write `_out/site/pdf/main.pdf`; use `--pdf-engine <cmd>` for another
lualatex-compatible command.

## Three-Level Blueprint Model

Blueprint keeps three related layers separate:

1. **Original sources and provenance.** These are the papers, PDFs, imported
   files, page references, and source spans that explain where the mathematical
   content came from.
2. **Informal Blueprint content.** This is the labeled mathematical statement,
   proof, or definition as Blueprint understands it. Native Verso bodies are
   the normal representation. Raw Markdown or TeX external markup can also be
   attached to a labeled node as a compatibility representation while porting an
   existing document.
3. **Formal Lean content.** This is the Lean code or declarations associated
   with a Blueprint label. It drives progress state, declaration panels, and
   links between the informal document and the formalization.

A single Blueprint node can have data from all three layers at once. For
example, a theorem can cite a source span in a PDF, keep a Markdown witness or
native Verso statement as its informal content, and link to one or more Lean
declarations. External Markdown and TeX attachments should be read as Level 2
informal content unless they are separately referenced by Level 1 source
provenance metadata.

## Core Features

### Labeled nodes and rich directives

Every Blueprint node is identified by a label such as `addition_spec` or
`addition_right_identity`. Those labels drive cross-references, graph nodes,
summary entries, code associations, external-markup associations, and metadata
export.

When roles such as `{uses "foo"}[]` or citations have an empty payload,
Blueprint can automatically render text such as `Theorem N`.
Metadata-only dependencies can be written on a block with
`(uses := "foo, bar")`; inline and metadata-only uses can also carry intent tags
such as `"regular"`, `"technical"`, or `"auxiliary"`, plus an origin of
`"manual"` or `"automatic"`. Statement and proof directives render separate
`uses` chips, so proof-only prerequisites can stay attached to the proof header
without being folded into the statement chip.

Typical directives look like:

- `:::definition "addition_spec" (lean := "Nat.add, Nat.succ")`
- `:::theorem "addition_right_identity" (owner := "jason") (priority := "high")`
- `:::proof "addition_right_identity"`

````md
:::definition "addition_spec" (lean := "Nat.add, Nat.succ")
We write $`a + b` for the result of adding $`b` to $`a`.
:::

:::theorem "addition_right_identity" (owner := "jason") (priority := "high")
For every natural number $`n`, adding zero on the right leaves it unchanged:
$`n + 0 = n`.
:::

```lean "addition_right_identity"
theorem nat_add_zero_right (n : Nat) : n + 0 = n := by
  simp
```
````

### Connecting to Lean

Blueprint supports three main ways to connect informal nodes to Lean:

- inline code with a labeled Lean code block
- compiled code tagged with `@[blueprint]` or
  `@[blueprint "addition_right_identity"]`
- existing declarations referenced with `(lean := "Nat.add_assoc")`

```lean
@[blueprint "addition_right_identity"]
theorem nat_add_zero_right (n : Nat) : n + 0 = n := by
  simp
```

The string selects a short, explicit Blueprint label. Omitting it uses the
declaration's qualified Lean name, so `@[blueprint] theorem
MyProject.nat_add_zero_right ...` is referenced as
`"MyProject.nat_add_zero_right"`. Attribute options remain available in the
bare form, for example `@[blueprint (uses := ["addition_spec"])]`.

After importing a Lean module containing tagged declarations, include one node
per distinct directly owned label as a source-ordered Manual part with:

```lean
{includeBlueprintModule 0 MyProject.Formalization.Addition (title := "Compiled Addition Results")}
```

The `import MyProject.Formalization.Addition` statement still belongs in the
Lean file header. When only one declaration should appear at a particular
location in an existing Manual chapter, place that node with:

```lean
{blueprint_node "addition_right_identity"}
```

The declaration docstring supplies the informal statement when present; without
one, Blueprint still renders a code-only node in either workflow. With
`set_option doc.verso true`, docstrings can use `{uses "label"}[]` to declare
statement dependencies and `{bpref "label"}[]` for links without edges. Put
proof dependencies on the attribute's `proofUses` option. Standard `doc.verso`
structure, including math, is preserved in both
the statement and the attached “Lean code for…” declaration panel. For the
precise dependency, prose, proof, metadata, and source-rendering boundaries, see
the Manual's
[“Attribute-first use-case matrix”](doc/MANUAL.md#attribute-first-use-case-matrix)
section.

Add `(autoDeps := true)` when a tagged declaration, labeled inline Lean block,
or `(lean := "...")` statement should infer statement/proof dependency edges to
Lean declarations that are already associated with Blueprint labels.
Inference follows unassociated helpers by default;
`set_option verso.blueprint.autoDeps.expandUntagged false` limits it to direct references.
You can also set
`set_option verso.blueprint.autoDeps true` for a file
or section, with local `(autoDeps := false)` available as an override. Inferred
edges are recorded with origin `"automatic"`; explicit `uses` and `proofUses`
entries remain manual unless written through the usual Blueprint dependency
syntax. Manual `{uses ...}` links remain available for prose-first Blueprint
nodes. Inference stops at each associated declaration; it does not flatten the
Blueprint graph by continuing through that declaration's own dependencies.
An empty inferred dependency list does not establish mathematical independence.
See [automatic dependency inference](doc/MANUAL.md#automatic-dependency-inference)
for the exact contract, registration timing, and a worked helper example.

```md
:::theorem "addition_assoc" (lean := "Nat.add_assoc, Nat.add_comm")
This informal node is linked to existing compiled Lean declarations.
:::
```

In this fork, a "Relation to the source." section in the docstring of a declaration named in
`(lean := ...)` is rendered as annotation boxes under the node's statement, with review badges
from a review ledger (`reviews.json`); `lake exe vbp build --hide-review` leaves the badges out.
See [TIMAEUS.md](TIMAEUS.md#annotations-from-docstrings).

### Attached Rust code

Blueprint also supports labeled inline Rust code blocks:

````md
:::definition "ffi_helper"
Helper routine mirrored in Rust.
:::

```rust "ffi_helper"
pub fn ffi_helper(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```
````

Current behavior:

- the Rust block attaches to the Blueprint node with the same label
- the rendered page shows an associated Rust code panel
- rendering uses a small built-in syntax highlighter
- Rust blocks do not currently affect Blueprint progress/status semantics
- Rust diagnostics and external Rust references are not part of the current surface

### Math, TeX, and external markup

Blueprint supports inline math such as ``$`n + 0 = n` `` and display math such as
``$$`\sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}` ``. It also supports TeX preludes via
`tex_prelude` and best-effort KaTeX linting during elaboration. KaTeX is the
renderer used by the generated HTML.

Blueprint nodes can also carry raw external markup through labeled `tex` and
`md` code blocks. These blocks are Level 2 informal representations in the
model above, not original-source provenance by themselves:

````md
:::theorem "addition_right_identity"
For every natural number $`n`, $`n + 0 = n`.
:::

```tex "addition_right_identity"
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:addition-right-identity}
For every natural number $n$, adding zero on the right leaves it unchanged.
\end{theorem}
```

```md "addition_right_identity" (slot := proof)
This was imported from a Markdown proof sketch.
```
````

Labeled standalone `tex` and `md` blocks are exported as semantic
external-markup catalog entries. Generated preview data also includes a
rendered fragment backed by that external markup for markup-only entries:
Markdown is rendered by MD4Lean with raw HTML disabled and falls back to escaped
source if MD4Lean cannot render it, while TeX is shown as escaped source.
Pass `--external-markup-render source` to force escaped source text, or
`--external-markup-render none` to keep manifest-only entries without generated
HTML cache fragments. When the same label also has a rendered Blueprint
statement or proof, the raw markup is attached to that block's manifest entry
instead. Bodyless Blueprint directives that carry `(lean := ...)` still
contribute their Lean preview keys and code data to the exported manifest entry;
the generator warns if that metadata is ever dropped during manifest export.

These `ExternalMarkup` attachments are primarily a porting aid for existing TeX
or Markdown documents. They are stored on the labeled node, exported in the
Blueprint manifest, and are not rendered at the code-block location in the
output site by default. Use `slot` names such as `statement` and `proof` when
one Blueprint node corresponds to multiple informal markup witnesses.

Blueprint can separately record Level 1 original-source provenance for audit
tools. Declare a source document with `:::source_document` and attach node-local
source spans in a leading Verso metadata block:

````md
:::source_document "paper"
%%%
title := "Representation Theory"
kind := .pdf
pdf := "source/paper.pdf"
%%%
:::

:::lemma_ "addition_right_identity"
%%%
source := {
  document := "paper"
  spans := #[
    {
      page := "12"
      anchor := "lem:addition-right-identity"
      citation := "Lemma 2.1(1)"
      pdf := some { path := "source/pages/page-12.pdf" }
    }
  ]
}
%%%

For every natural number $`n`, $`n + 0 = n`.
:::
````

Current behavior: source provenance is exported in the Blueprint manifest as
`sourceDocuments` and per-entry `sources`. A sourced node shows a compact chip;
when an entry has exactly one source ref and that ref has one unique citation,
the chip says, for example, `source: Lemma 2.1(1)` rather than presenting the
citation as Blueprint's own generated number. Entries with multiple source refs
retain the `sources N` summary so that the chip does not hide aggregated
provenance.
Browser clients can resolve source-document ids with `loadSourceDocument`, load
the complete catalog with `loadSourceDocuments`, or join entry source refs with
declared documents using `resolveSourceMetadata` from `api/data.mjs` or
`api/preview.mjs`.
Manifest entries also carry source-location lookup results. Custom browser
clients can call `resolveLabel` for Blueprint labels or `resolveDeclaration`
for Lean declarations when they need jump-to-source targets.
Rich audit-interface rendering is planned separately.

### Rendering to HTML

Blueprint can render:

- chapter pages
- a dependency graph with `blueprint_graph`
- an overview and progress summary page with `blueprint_summary`
- a bibliography page with `blueprint_bibliography`
- math-enabled previews and cross-links
- associated Rust code panels for labeled inline Rust blocks

The graph page is interactive rather than static: it can expose a view switcher
for grouped graphs, a legend popover, a `Graph options` control for direction
and component-packing switches, and graph-node previews that can be configured
as pinned or hover panels with docked or anchored placement.

Progress is computed automatically from the status of the associated Lean code
and declarations, so the HTML summary and graph views stay aligned with the
formal side. In particular, incomplete Lean declarations such as `sorry`
contribute automatically to the reported progress state.

### Metadata export

For common label, dependency, planning, and metadata queries, use
`lake exe vbp query`. Lower-level tools can also dump the complete semantic
manifest, its schema, and the rendered-fragment cache
(`blueprint-html-cache.json`) used by preview consumers. The cache includes the
hover payloads needed by cached Lean fragments. These are command-line flags
passed to the generator entry point, such as
`--dump-manifest`, `--dump-html-cache`, and `--dump-schema`. See
[doc/API.md](./doc/API.md) for the current generated-data contract.

### JavaScript API tooling

The browser APIs emitted under `-verso-data/api/` remain plain JavaScript ESM.
API documentation is written in JSDoc, rendered with Docdash, and TypeScript
checks the public API entrypoints plus their direct support modules with
`allowJs` and `checkJs`.
The generated-site public browser entrypoints are `api/preview.mjs`,
`api/data.mjs`, and `api/graph.mjs`; the other emitted JavaScript modules are
private runtime support chunks for those entrypoints and generated pages.
This first pass intentionally focuses on the custom-client API surface; broader
private runtime coverage and `noImplicitAny` tightening are follow-up cleanup
items. TypeScript users consume generated declaration files from `dist/types`;
those files are build artifacts and are not tracked in source.

Useful maintainer commands:

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build:types`
- `npm run check:types`
- `npm run docs`
- `npm run check:docs`

The rendered API reference is deployed on GitHub Pages at
[leanprover.github.io/verso-blueprint/js-api/](https://leanprover.github.io/verso-blueprint/js-api/).
CI also uploads the same generated HTML as the `js-api-docs` artifact on each
`ci.yml` run for PR-local inspection.

Custom clients can import the generated preview module directly from a rendered
site:

```js
import { createPreview } from "./-verso-data/api/preview.mjs";

const preview = createPreview();
const container = document.querySelector("#target");
if (!container) throw new Error("Missing preview target");

await preview.renderNode(container, {
  label: "Chapter2:Problem2.11.6",
  externalMarkup: {
    prefer: [
      { language: "verso", slot: "statement" },
      {
        language: "markdown",
        slot: "original",
        render: async ({ raw }, target) => {
          target.replaceChildren(renderMarkdown(raw));
        }
      },
      { display: "source" }
    ]
  }
});
```

### Widget

The widget surface is experimental. Import `VersoBlueprint.Widget` explicitly if
you want to enable it.

## Reference Blueprints

Reference blueprints are known Blueprint projects that this repository builds
and publishes as release validation examples. They are useful for checking that
the renderer still works on real projects and for inspecting representative
generated output; they are not the starter template contract for new projects.

The current published catalog is selected from `branch-policy.json` and
`tests/harness/projects.json`; those files are the source of truth for which
reference projects publish on each Lean release line. Maintainers can inspect
the current checkout's selected projects with
`python3 -m scripts.blueprint_reference_harness projects`.

Each external Blueprint is published only for its intended current release.
Noperthedron, FLT, Carleson, and the
[Sphere Packing integration](https://github.com/ejgallego/verso-sphere-packing)
currently target `v4.34.0`, the sole maintained release line. The in-repo
starter template is a CI fixture rather than a public reference entry; it is
validated on that line.

## Rendered Test Blueprints

The deployed test-fixture sites live under the GitHub Pages `test-blueprints`
tree:

- [categorized test blueprint index](https://leanprover.github.io/verso-blueprint/test-blueprints/)
- [preview runtime showcase](https://leanprover.github.io/verso-blueprint/test-blueprints/preview_runtime_showcase/html-multi/)

The distinction is:

- the categorized test blueprint index is the directory page for all local
  HTML-producing test fixtures
- `preview_runtime_showcase` is one specific standalone rendered site listed in
  that directory

Most entries in the test blueprint index are curated doc-backed fixtures. The
showcase is different: it is a small standalone Blueprint package used for the
browser/runtime regression path and for exercising richer cross-page behavior in
one place.

### Agent Helper Skill

The repository includes an agent-facing skill under
[`skills/verso-blueprint/`](./skills/verso-blueprint/) for Codex/Claude-style
local coding agents. The skill teaches agents to use `lake exe vbp ...` for
project discovery, build/serve previews, generated-data queries, and
post-edit checks.

`lake exe vbp build` is the normal Blueprint generation interface for projects.
It discovers the project generator and asks Lake to build its imports and run
it. Treat `vbp` query JSON as an unstable agent interface, not a public
compatibility contract and not part of the documented integration API.

### Maintainer CLI Split

The repository now uses two small maintainer CLIs instead of one large mixed
surface:

- `python3 -m scripts.blueprint_harness`
  Worktree creation, root release-branch checks, landing, and local coordination
- `python3 -m scripts.blueprint_reference_harness`
  Reference-project generation, validation, cache sync, editable reference
  checkouts, and prune operations

The shell wrappers under [`scripts/`](./scripts/) still front the common
reference-generation and validation flows.
